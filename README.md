<h1>TOP Etch-a-Sketch </h1>
<p>This project once again took me longer than expected. There was so much basics that I still do not fully understand. As usual, this can be improved even more but I'm really tired.
<br><br>I didn't change the opacity like requested because lower opacity causes the black color to look green instead. Therefore, I only changed the L value in the HSL, decreasing by 10 so user has to enter the element 10 times
to reach Hsl(0,0%,0%).
<br><br> This was a very fun but tiring project, with much googling and learning. </p>
