<h1>TOP Etch-a-Sketch </h1>
<p>This project once again took me longer than expected. There was so much basics that I still do not fully understand. As usual, this can be improved even more but I'm really tired.
  
I didn't change the opacity like requested because lower opacity causes the black color to look green instead. Therefore, I only changed the L value in the HSL, decreasing by 10 so user has to enter the element 10 times to reach Hsl(0,0%,0%).
  
I put in 2 scripts because I at first used number input type instead of button at the beginning. I personally think that number input type is better? But I needed to learn how to use button to prompt and used the 
user input as well, so I still did the button input type. I didn't decide to choose to change the opacity because I think the concept is pretty similar to changing the L value in the HSL, in which we get the ID of the grid then link with the new value of the HSL but just replace HSL with opacity if needed.
  
This was a very fun but tiring project, with much googling and learning. </p>
